Protocol Gateway meant to convert one protocol to another. It had three protocol implementations: MODBUS RTU, MODBUS TCP, CANBUS. The requester could send a message on any of these protocols and then the gateway would convert it to another one, making it "transparent" for the developers of each side. It was developed while I was working at CERTI Foundation.
