<p>As you already may know, my name is Bruno Luiz da Silva. I am <strong class='engineering'>enrolled on electrical engineering</strong> but I have interests in many other fields, such as design, programming and business. With this mixed knowledge, I am able to have new ideas and perceive the world differently.</p>

<p>I <strong class='design'>love design</strong> and I understand its importance for the user experience in a project. I am really <strong class='dev'>passionate with web development</strong> (back and frontend), mainly because it is easier and faster to build software using web technologies and this enables me <strong class='entrepreneurship'>to develop my own projects and startups</strong> (check Deliverama and Neoviz projects). <strong class='embedded'>Recently, what I mostly worked with was embedded systems</strong> - C/C++ and recently Java - with different types of hardware.</p>

<p>In this page, you can check what I have been working on lately (some projects are available on my Github). If you are convinced that we, together, can get your idea out of the scratch, <a href="#contact">contact me</a> and let's make it happen.</p>

<p>Cheers ;)</p>
